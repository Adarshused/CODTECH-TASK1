# Overview of the project:
__PROJECT:Data-Preprocessing__  
__objective__:  
The objective of this Project is to perfom Data-PreProcessing on any dataset.Data processing involves tranforming raw data into a clean and usable format
to ensure machine learning algorithms can process it effectively.  
__Steps_Involving__:   
1) Data cleaning- Handling missing values ,correcting errors and removing outliers  
2) Data Encoding- encoding numerical and categorical data's for handling missing values  
3) Data scaling- adjusting the range of the feature value by using Normalization and Standardization  
4) Data splitting - Dividing the dataset into training ,validation and testing sets

__Technology used__:  
1) Python- python is widely used for data preprocessing due to its extensive libraries  
2) Pandas- essential library for data manipulation and analysis  
3) NumPy- used for numerical computing and handling arrays  
4) scikit-learn- provides range of supervisied and unsupervisied learing algorithms
